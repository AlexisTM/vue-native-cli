# Vue Native

## Build Native Mobile apps using Vue

> Vue Native is a wrapper around the APIs of React Native. So, with Vue Native, you can do everything what you can do with React Native.

A basic cli that generates a simple 1 page application with [create-react-native-app](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app),
[vue-native-core](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/vue-native-core)

## Installation:

```
$ npm install -g vue-native-cli
```

Generate [CRNA + Vue App](https://github.com/GeekyAnts/vue-native-core) App

```
$ vue-native init <projectName>
```

## Todo:

* Add React Native Navigation.
* Add Demo App Link.
* Improve Debugging, tracing, error reporting.
